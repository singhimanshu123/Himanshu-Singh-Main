# Himanshu Singh's Portfolio
Welcome!
I've always wanted to create a portfolio showcasing my skills. This portfolio serves as a showcase of my journey and a place to explore my various side projects, including video games. I've included elements that reflect my personal interests, such as my favorite video games, an interactive Rubik's cube, and an arcade machine.
